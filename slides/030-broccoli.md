Note:

 broccoli. I am not here today to dump on broccoli, I actually loved it as a build system and build a whole bunch of tools and project on it. but it had some fundemental assumptions that are not really compatible with the needs of modern build systems 

 Broccoli at its heart is just a file layering system. It came out in the days of Grunt and Gulp and was actually really sofistcated compared to those "build systems"
