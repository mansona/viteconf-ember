# History of Ember

This is a slide! 

If this is intended to be a section you can add new sections using `---` to delimit new slides

Note:

This talk will have to do a little bit of work on the history of Ember and its build systmes before we can even touch on why Ember using vite is an interesting topic, but once we cover the history I'm going to jump into some of the interesting architecture in a project called Embroider and now it acts as a translation layer to help Vite know what to look for when building an Ember app
