Note:

This talk will have to do a little bit of work on the history of Ember before we can even touch on why Ember using vite is an interesting topic, but once we cover the history I'm going to jump into a tiny code example that should help to illustrate the how Ember and Vite can work together and why it is even a challenge in the first place
