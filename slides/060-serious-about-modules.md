# Serious about Modules?

This is a slide!

Note:

The second issue that we had was that Vite takes ES modules seriously. Sure we were pioneers in the use of modules in ember but that was mostly just authoring format. ember-cli rebuilt everything into AMD modules under the hood 

ðŸ™ˆ

not great, but what is worse is that even with Embroider and Webpack it boiled down to a horrible AMD with webpack eval monstrocity in the build output. 

If we were serious about Vite we needed to get serious about modules and clean up our act.

Now we had the bones of a plan but there was a tonne of work still to do, it was going to take a long time if we didn't change the script.
