I've had the absolute pleasure to work on the Embroider Initiative, which was a coming together of a lot of the big companies using Ember to fund work specifically on getting Ember ready for this new wave of build systems. The headline deliverable of this year long initiative was to get Ember apps building with vite and I am very happy to say that we succeeded!
