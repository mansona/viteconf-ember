# Embroider Initative

Note:

I've had the absolute pleasure to work on the Embroider Initiative, a coming together of a lot of the big companies using Ember to fund work specifically on getting Ember ready for this new wave of build systems. The headline deliverable of this year long initiative was to get Ember apps building with vite and I am very happy to say that we succeeded! You can opt into using vite to build your ember app by running this command to generate a new ember app and we're working hard to make this so seamless that it is the default experience for everyone generating a new app. You can follow the progress by keeping track of this RFC - add link
