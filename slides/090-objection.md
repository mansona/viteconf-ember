Note:

I would say don't even try it! It's not really possible because broccoli is a strange tangled mess of very timing specific things that is next to impossible to pick apart without the whole thing coming crashing down

so what's the solution? well... just run the strange broccoli stuff and save the output somewhere! Then you can clean up the output to make it look like a more reasonable package and hey presto you have created yourself what we call a rewritten package.

and this brings us to our first bit of metadata that we need to save. What packages were rewritten and where did we rewrite them to?
