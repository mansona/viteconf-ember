# Three stages of Embroider


<div class="card-wrapper">
<div class="card-thingy  fragment">
  
Stage 1

convert all your addons <!-- .element style="text-align: left; width: 90%;" -->

</div> 

<div class="card-thingy  fragment">

Stage 2 

convert your app <!-- .element style="text-align: left; width: 90%;" -->

</div> 

<div class="card-thingy fragment">


Stage 3 

Pass your converted app and addons over to your bundler <!-- .element style="text-align: left; width: 90%;" -->

That's vite ðŸŽ‰ <!-- .element class="fragment" style="font-size: 60%;" -->

</div> 
</div>


Note:

I mentioned that embroider allows you to use all your normal Ember build shenanigans but allows you to upgrade to use modern tooling. well that's because we convert all the broccoli nonsense into "real" packages for you in stage 1 and stage 2. we then pass those converted packages off to the bundler in stage 3

If you were thinking you would approach this sort of auto upgrade of broccoli build shenanigans by maybe emulating the broccoli API
