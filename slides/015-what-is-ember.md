# What is Ember

This is a slide! 

If this is intended to be a section you can add new sections using `---` to delimit new slides

Note:

First things first, what is EmberJS? Ember is a 13 year old, Batteries Included Frontend Framework. 13 years!! that is positively geriatric if you consider the pace of new frameworks comign out but even though it's been around for a long time that doesn't mean that it feels old when you're working with it. WE have managed to innovate pretty deeply over the past 13 years in such a way that has not sacrificed the stability of your apps

What do I mean by innovation!?
