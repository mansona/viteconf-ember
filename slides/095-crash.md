# Crash

This is a slide! 

If this is intended to be a section you can add new sections using `---` to delimit new slides

Note:

so what's the solution? well... just run the strange broccoli stuff and save the output somewhere! Then you can clean up the output to make it a more reasonable package and hey presto you have created yourself a rewritten package.

and this brings us to our first bit of metadata that we need to save. What packages were rewritten and where did we rewrite them to?
