# Embroider

This is a slide! 

If this is intended to be a section you can add new sections using `---` to delimit new slides

Note:

Embroider is like a semi-magical glue code that bridges the gap beween the old way of doing things in Ember and the new. It allows you to use all of your existing ember concepts like addons, strange fake modules, automatic file discovery etc but it essentially pre-processes all your ember-cli based broccoli trees and outputs a (semi) prestine app that a bundler like Webpack can look at and do its magic. 

Woo hoo, problem solved let's ship Embroider to everyone! ... not so fast. literally.
