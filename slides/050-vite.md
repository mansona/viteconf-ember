Note:

Vite started being the new hotness, and people were excited to try and get Ember working with Vite, but oh boy, was it not so simple. A few things made it difficult, firstly Vite didn't really want to be crammed in this clunky tree structure, for the magic of the Vite dev experience to shine you really need Vite to be running the show. Vite needs to be in the driver's seat
