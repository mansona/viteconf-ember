Note:

Vite started being the new hotness, and people were excited to try and get Ember working with Vite, but oh boy, was it not so simple. A few things made it difficult, firstly Vite didn't really want to be crammed in this clunky tree structure, for the magic of the Vite dev experience to shine you really need Vite to be running the show. Vite needs to be in the driver's seat

Embroider needed to start taking a back seat and only answering some questions but only when Vite asked. We called this inversion of control, you run vite with an Ember/Embroider plugin rather than running ember-cli with a vite plugin.
