# Ember's Innovation

- ES Classes
- ES Modules
- Build systems

Note:

Classes in JavaScript actually happened with Ember's help, Ember Core Team members were working with TC39 at the time they were being added.
ES modules - we were using them as part of our authoring format before they were in the language.
ember-cli, our baked in build system, was so ahead of its time that there were many arguments about if frameworks even needed a build system at the time. And since we're all here at ViteConf, I guess the team build system has won that particular battle!!

but with all those firsts we have a few problems, expeicially when we care so much about stability and not leaving anyone behind. our pree-class "class" object was the basis for all the major building blocks of the framework. We've cleaned up a bunch of them but still not all of them
